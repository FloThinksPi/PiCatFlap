PiCatFlap
====

Warning: Verry Quick and dirty code, just wanted to get this working! 

My first node.js application is made with Express, Socket.io , Python 
and mjpg-streamer(https://github.com/codewithpassion/mjpg-streamer/tree/master/mjpg-streamer-experimental)
It use Webflow and Jquery_UI + Jquery.

## What can it do(via Webfrontend)?
	- Responsive Design
	- Open your CatFlap via Servo 
	- Display IR-RaspiCam Livestream 
	- Dimm IR-LEDs (Controll Brightness)
	- Node.js & socket.io for Synchronized Frontend
	- Send Notifcations to your Phone(based a PIR Sensor and Door Sensor)
